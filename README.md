# solitaire_solver
A personal project to create a progressively more accurate solitaire solver!
I plan to make this my portfolio and create a website to display it.

I want this project to demonstrate a combination of three skills I pride myself in.
- My ability to create clean code and utilize github to preserve a well made repository.
- My exploration and utilization of machine learning and algorithms.
- My strength in handling and gathering data for data visualization and analysis.


Contents:
- A functional solitaire board that, through console commands, can be solved by the user.
- A (potentially) series of algorithms that each solve the solitaire board in different ways
- A display of data visualization
